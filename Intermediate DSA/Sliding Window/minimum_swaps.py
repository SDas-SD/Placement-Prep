# Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to B together.

# Note: It is possible to swap any two elements, not necessarily consecutive.

class Solution:
    # @param arr : list of integers
    # @param k : integer
    # @return an integer
