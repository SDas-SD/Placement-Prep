# You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size Q*2. Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
# For every query, the task is to calculate the sum of all even indices in the range A[B[i][0]â€¦B[i][1]].

# Note : Use 0-based indexing

    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
